### **1. Basics of OOP**
- **What is OOP?**  
  - Understand the paradigm and its purpose.
  - Compare OOP with Procedural Programming.

- **Core Principles of OOP:**  
  - **Encapsulation:** Controlling access to data via getters and setters.  
  - **Abstraction:** Hiding complexity while exposing only essentials.  
  - **Inheritance:** Reusing and extending existing code.  
  - **Polymorphism:** Using a single interface to represent different types.

- **Objects and Classes:**  
  - How to define and use them.
  - Difference between instances and prototypes.

- **Getters and Setters:**  
  - Retrieve and update private variables.  
  - Add validation or logging for controlled access.  

---

### **2. Intermediate Topics**
- **Constructors:**  
  - Creating and initializing objects.

- **Access Modifiers:**  
  - `public`, `private`, `protected`.

- **Static Members:**  
  - Shared properties and methods.

- **`this` Keyword:**  
  - Context and usage in objects and methods.

- **Method Overloading and Overriding:**  
  - Defining multiple methods with the same name but different behaviors.

---

### **3. Advanced OOP Concepts**
- **Abstract Classes and Interfaces:**  
  - Enforcing structure in subclasses.

- **Inheritance:**  
  - Single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance.

- **Composition:**  
  - Using "has-a" relationships instead of inheritance.

- **Polymorphism:**  
  - Compile-time (method overloading).  
  - Run-time (method overriding).

---

### **4. Design Principles and Patterns**
- **SOLID Principles:**  
  - Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, etc.

- **Common Design Patterns:**  
  - Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy.

---

### **5. Language-Specific Features (Optional)**
- Features like Prototypes in JavaScript, Virtual Functions in C++, etc.

---

### **6. Testing and Debugging OOP**
- Unit Testing classes and objects.
- Mocking dependencies.

---

### **7. Practical Applications**
- Real-world modeling with OOP.
- Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).
